We aim to respond within 72 hours.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that researchers:

- Give us reasonable time to investigate and patch
- Avoid exploiting vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept
- Avoid accessing, modifying, or deleting user data

We are committed to working transparently and respectfully with security researchers.

## Security Philosophy

QSpace Pages is being built with:

- Secure-by-default architecture
- Minimal exposed attack surface
- Strong authentication boundaries
- Encrypted communication channels
- Least-privilege service design

As the OpenARQ modules are extracted, they will undergo independent security hardening and review.

## Future Enhancements

Planned security improvements include:

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging
- API rate limiting
- Automated security scanning
- External security audits
